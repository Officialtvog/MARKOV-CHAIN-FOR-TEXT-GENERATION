      "The speed of transmission is an important point of difference between the two viruses. Influenza has a shorter median incubation period (the time from infection to appearance of symptoms) and a shorter serial interval (the time between successive cases) than COVID-19 virus. The serial interval for COVID-19 virus is estimated to be 5-6 days, while for influenza virus, the serial interval is 3 days. This means that influenza can spread faster than COVID-19. \n",
      "\n",
      "Further, transmission in the first 3-5 days of illness, or potentially pre-symptomatic transmission â€“transmission of the virus before the appearance of symptoms â€“ is a major driver of transmission for influenza. In contrast, while we are learning that there are people who can shed COVID-19 virus 24-48 hours prior to symptom onset, at present, this does not appear to be a major driver of transmission. \n",

      "The reproductive number â€“ the number of secondary infections generated from one infected individual â€“ is understood to be between 2 and 2.5 for COVID-19 virus, higher than for influenza.
